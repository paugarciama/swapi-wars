# About this project

## Language and Framework

For this project, I've used Javascript (ES6+) and Vue 3. 

Talking about Vue 3, I've worked with the Composition API for every script, using setup() structure, composable functions to modularize and reuse code, refs to bring reactivity to the elements, and more great stuff. 

I've taken the communication between components via props and emits, 
as there was no need of using Vuex at this point. I've used Vue Router to set views for each category and dynamic routes to see details of an individual element.
